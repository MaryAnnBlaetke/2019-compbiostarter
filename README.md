# Metabolic Modelling Course @ CompBioStarter2019


## Part 1 - Introduction
In the first part of this course, we will discuss the importance of mathematical modelling to enhance the understanding about real-world systems and to make prediction about the systems behaviour. 
Next, we will focus on metabolic networks, their construction and purpose and the application of flux balance analysis to investigate the flux distribution optimised for a specific criteria subjected to a set of constraints.

## Part 2 - Excerise
In the second part of this course, we will go through the [cobrapy](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/) Tutorial provided at [ReadTheDocs](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to learn baout the very basics, from loading to manipulatin/building models to perfrom a simple FBA and beyond.

### Working Environment
In this course, we use the [python](https://www.python.org) as programming languages and the [cobrapy](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/) package for constraint-based modelling of biological networks, which is part of the [openCobra](http://opencobra.github.io) project. 
For live coding we will use the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) implementation at [Google Colabratory](). 
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. If you prefer to run your own Jupyter Notebook instance, we recommand installing it via [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org).

## Requirements
Some experience in coding, preferably using python.
